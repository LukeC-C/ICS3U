**Welcome to the world's most complete and working chess game!***


**---How to play---**
Look up the chess rules, way too much to try and say here.


**---Things done---**
Movement is working and includes restrictions (ex: rook moves horizontally, bishop moves diagonally, etc).

Intro screen with option to continue a saved game or start a new one.

Game saving fully functional.


**---Things sort of done---**
Taking peices; you can take them but the icon doesn't disappear for the taken peice.

Dealing with the images in general is still pretty buggy, so if one ever disappears
you can identify the peice by the debugging nomenclature that I used and is still there
for this specific case: the first two letters corespond to the peice, the third references the color.
Ex Pa_W is a white pawn, Bi_B is a black bishop.

On the topic of images, the chessboard image I made can be put on the screen but, despite using the exact same techniques for this as I used elsewhere, I couldn't get it to not interfere with the peices, so it's hidden for now. 


**---Things not done---**
Castling, blocking peice's movement (ex stopping a pawn from moving foreword by putting a rook in front of it) and check/checkmate dont't work. If I find out how to get one of them working, the rest rely on a similar concept that will make them extremely easy to finish. Obiously, I haven't gotten that figured out yet.


**---Notes for Ms. Torres---**
As this is technically a school project (despite the fact that it barely feels like one anymore with the amount I've worked on it at home.), I thought I should write some notes about the code here. All comments are either notes on what a block of code or method does or code that has yet to be finished and is still in development. Also, a lot but not all of the i, j, k, l, x, and y variables are swapped, it's just the way it is so that it can work. A fair amount of the time switching those variables around would fix the problem and I was too tired to find another solution so here we are now. Anyways, thanks for the awesome year Ms. Torres and I hope to see you again next year in g12 cs!
(PS: sorry for the janky movement right now, try clicking on a peice multiple times before clicking the desired square if you are having issues with it).


**---Thoughts and comments---**
This project has been a hell of a ride, that's for sure. I probably spent about 150+ hours on this project, most of that debugging that's not even come to fruition yet. I've learned a lot through this as it's definitly been my most ambitious project yet, noteably how to use the debugger vs code to find logic errors efficiently (hahaha..). I'll probably come back to this in the future, but for now I want to pursue other projects + robotics club (2d game in unity maybe?).

Wow, you made it down to line 999. Why are you here again?                      No, i'm not going to go to line 1000.
